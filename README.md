# Activity Recognition

The purpose of this repository is to classify human activities from video streams.

## Getting started

1. create a folder `data/archives/`
3. download all archives there
3. run `./extract.sh`   # For the sake of God, I hope you have Linux or MacOS

## Data folder

The data folder contains:

 - a folder called `archives` that contains the original `zip` and `tar.gz` files
 - a folder called `raw` that contains the data extracted from the archives
 - a script `extract.sh` that inflates all data from `archives` to `raw`
